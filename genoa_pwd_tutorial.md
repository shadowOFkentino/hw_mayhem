## Documentation: Updating BMC Password Using Redfish API

### Overview

This document outlines the steps to update the BMC password on an ASRock Rack GENOAD8X-2T/BCM motherboard using Redfish API commands, which can be necessary when initial access requires a password update. This approach involves verifying the current account status, retrieving the necessary ETag for validation, and meeting specific password requirements.

### Requirements

- **curl**: Command-line tool for making HTTP requests.
- **Redfish API access**: Enabled on the BMC.
- **New Password**: Must meet minimal security requirements (e.g., length and complexity).

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Verify Account Status

1. First, check if a password update is required by accessing the AccountService endpoint in a browser or with curl:

   **Command**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u admin:admin https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u admin:admin https://192.168.88.182/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

2. **Expected Output**: If a password change is required, youâ€™ll see a response with a message like:
   ```
   "The password provided for this account must be changed before access is granted."
   ```

#### Step 2: Retrieve the ETag Value

1. Retrieve the ETag value associated with the account, which is required to validate the password update request.

   **Command**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u admin:admin -I https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u admin:admin -I https://192.168.88.182/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

2. **Expected Output**: Look for the `ETag` header in the response headers, which will look something like:
   ```
   ETag: "W/\"1640995245\""
   ```
   
   **Note**: Copy this `ETag` value (including the quotes) as it will be needed in the next step.

#### Step 3: Update the Password

1. Set a new password that meets minimum length and complexity requirements (e.g., 8+ characters, including uppercase, lowercase, and numbers).

2. Use the following curl command to update the password, replacing `<etag_value>` with the actual ETag retrieved in Step 2 and `<new_password>` with the desired new password.

   **Command**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -X PATCH -u admin:admin \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H 'If-Match: "<etag_value>"' \
        -d '{"Password": "<new_password>"}' \
        https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -X PATCH -u admin:admin \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H 'If-Match: "1640995245"' \
        -d '{"Password": "Genova123!"}' \
        https://192.168.88.182/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `-X PATCH`: Specifies the HTTP method as PATCH.
   - `If-Match`: Provides the ETag value for validation.
   - `-d '{"Password": "<new_password>"}'`: Sets the new password in JSON format.

#### Step 4: Verify Password Update

1. To confirm the password was successfully updated, test access to the AccountService endpoint using the new credentials:

   **Command**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u admin:<new_password> https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u admin:Genova123! https://192.168.88.182/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

2. **Expected Output**: If the login is successful, the account details will be returned, confirming the new password is active.

### Summary of Commands

1. **Verify Account Needs Update**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u admin:admin https://192.168.88.182/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4
   ```

2. **Retrieve ETag**:
   ```bash

### Important Notes

- **Password Requirements**: The BMC may enforce minimum password requirements, typically 8+ characters including uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
- **Troubleshooting**: If the ETag value changes, re-run Step 2 to retrieve the updated ETag and retry the password update command.
- **BMC Timeout**: Some BMCs may take longer to apply updates. If you encounter timeouts, try the commands again.
